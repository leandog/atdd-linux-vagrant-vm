# atdd-linux-vagrant-vm
A Vagrant virtual machine already built with Ruby, RVM, RubyMine, SublimeText & Git installed. This VM is meant to be used in conjunction with the LeanDog ATDD course.

## Host OS Requirements

  * VirtualBox 5.1.6 or higher [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  * Vagrant 1.8.5 or higher [https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

## Basic Workflow

  * ```vagrant up``` - Downloads the pre-made box from the cloud, and generates a VM on your machine
  * Once the machine is up, you should see the lock screen and the LeanDog logo on the desktop
